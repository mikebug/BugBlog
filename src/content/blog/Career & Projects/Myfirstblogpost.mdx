# My First Project My Blog

#### Building a Blog with Astro, ChatGPT, and Copilot

As a developer, I've been eager to create my own blog for some time now. Inspired by the wealth of technology and development blogs I've been reading, I decided to take the plunge and start my own blogging journey.
<br />
I began by exploring the Astro framework, a modern static site generator that caught my eye. The [Astro blog theme](https://astro.build/themes/details/blog/) provided a great starting point, and I decided to use it as a base for my project.
<br />
One of the key decisions I made was to leverage the power of AI-powered tools like ChatGPT and Copilot to assist me in the development process. I had previously used these tools for simple tasks and prompts, but I was curious to see how they would perform on a larger-scale project.
<br />
To my initial excitement, the prospect of having AI-powered assistance seemed like it would greatly streamline the development experience. I eagerly dove in, using ChatGPT and Copilot to help with various aspects of the project, from building out components and page layouts to generating code snippets and solving specific challenges.
<br />
However, as I progressed, I encountered some unexpected challenges. The code and suggestions provided by ChatGPT, while sometimes helpful, were often inconsistent with my own coding standards and best practices. I found myself spending more time reviewing and refining the AI-generated content than I had anticipated.
<br />
In contrast, my experience with Claude, another AI assistant, was much more positive. Claude's responses were more accurate and aligned with my requirements, allowing me to integrate its suggestions more seamlessly into my codebase. I found that using Claude in a more targeted manner, such as for specific file structures or bat scripts, was significantly more effective than relying on ChatGPT for larger-scale development tasks.
<br />
Ultimately, I learned that while AI-powered tools can be immensely helpful in streamlining certain aspects of the development process, they should be used judiciously and with a critical eye. The most effective approach, in my experience, was to use these tools as a complement to my own coding skills, relying on them primarily for knowledge gaps, quick tasks, and autocomplete functionality, rather than as the primary driver of the project's development.
